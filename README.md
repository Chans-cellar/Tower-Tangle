# Tower Tangle

Tower Tangle is a block stacking game created using Three.js and Cannon.js. It is inspired by the article [Build a Stack Game using Three.js](https://blog.devgenius.io/build-a-stack-game-using-three-js-ea4d09963a62) and serves as a great resource for learning how to simulate game mechanics within Three.js and practice data structures.

## Gameplay

The objective of Tower Tangle is to stack blocks as high as possible without toppling over. The player controls the movement of a block horizontally using the keyboard or mouse controls, and the block automatically falls down due to gravity. The challenge lies in placing the blocks precisely to create a stable tower.

As the tower grows taller, the blocks become smaller, requiring greater precision and skill to maintain stability. The game ends when the tower collapses.

## Technologies Used

Tower Tangle utilizes the following technologies:

- **Three.js**: A JavaScript library for creating and rendering 3D graphics in the browser.
- **Cannon.js**: A lightweight 3D physics engine for simulating realistic physics behavior in the game.
- **HTML**: The structure and layout of the game interface are created using HTML.
- **CSS**: Styling and visual enhancements are implemented using CSS.
